# How to use
We recommend using the notebook FinalNotebook.ipynb \
The packages required are shown and installed in the notebook.
It is necessary to download one or more of the datasets from https://recsys.eb.dk/ as explained below.

# Setup for the dataset

1. Download the eb_nerd dataset locally on your computer.
2. Create the following folder: `RecSysGroup27/ebnerd_data`.
3. Extract the dataset into the `ebnerd_data` folder. \
The folder should contain the following datasets: \
`ebnerd_data/ebnerd_demo` \
`ebnerd_data/ebnerd_large` \
`ebnerd_data/ebnerd_small` \
`ebnerd_data/ebnerd_testset`

Not all datasets are needed. ebnerd_large is only needed if you want to run on the large dataset and ebnerd_testset is only needed if you want to run on the test set. We recommend only using ebnerd_small and ebnerd_demo.
